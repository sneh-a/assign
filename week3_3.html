        Style sheets are a convenient way to create a document with a uniform theme. With external style sheets (i.e.,
        separate documents that contain only CSS rules), you can provide a
        uniform look and feel to an entire website (or to a portion of one). You can also reuse the
        same external style sheet across multiple websites. Different pages on a site can all use the
        same style sheet. When changes to the styles are required, you need to modify only a single
        CSS file to make style changes across all the pages that use those styles. This concept is
        sometimes known as skinning. While embedded style sheets separate content from presentation, both are still
        contained in a single file, preventing a web designer and a content
        author from conveniently working in parallel. External style sheets solve this problem by
        separating the content and style into separate files.

        Figure 4.7 presents an external style sheet. Lines 1–2 are CSS comments. These may
        be placed in any type of CSS code (i.e., inline styles, embedded style sheets and external
        style sheets) and always start with /* and end with */. Text between these delimiters is
        ignored by the browser. The rules in this external style sheet are the same as those in the
        embedded style sheet in Fig. 4.6, lines 10–16.
